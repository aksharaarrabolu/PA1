Array: Arrays are versatile data structures designed to store multiple values within a single variable. 
They are unique in their ability to contain multiple elements simultaneously, allowing for efficient data management. 
By associating each value with an index number, you can easily access specific elements within the array. 
This property makes arrays an essential tool for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. 
 
Linked List: 
A linked list is a linear data structure that shares similarities with arrays. 
It consists of interconnected nodes, each comprising two essential components: data and a reference or link connecting it to another node. 
In the example provided, we have a linked list consisting of four nodes, with each node containing character data and a reference to the subsequent node. 
The first node, to which the head points, serves as the entry point for accessing all elements within the linked list.
 
In practice, we frequently utilize different data structures for storing data, and each of these structures comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. 
For example, certain data structures excel at efficiently adding or deleting data, while others may struggle with searching operations. 
This assignment aims to delve into a comparison between two fundamental data structures: linked lists and arrays. 
Through this assignment, you will gain a deeper understanding of the practical distinctions between these two data structures, shedding light on their respective advantages and limitations.
